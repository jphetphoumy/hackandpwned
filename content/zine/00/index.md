Welcome to **Hackandpwned Zine**, Issue #00.

Issue 00 is the official entry point of the Hackandpwned webzine. In this issue, I’ll repost articles I’ve previously published on the site and add new insights on hacking, DevOps, and Large Language Models (LLMs). It’s a chance to gather my past work in one place, while also sharing fresh perspectives on technology and the direction of the webzine.

In this prelude issue, I’ll explore some fundamental Linux hacking techniques and show how I use Large Language Models (LLMs) in my day-to-day work as a DevOps engineer. I’ll also share everything I’ve learned about prompt engineering—practical techniques you can start applying to your own workflows right away.
